* The user can press one or more number buttons to create their first number, then an option between one of the mathematical operations, input another number the same way as the first, then press equal to see their result
* The button marked "C" at the top left lets the user reset the text box to 0 and clear all operations and numbers from the calculator
* The button marked "+/-" allows the user to change numbers from positive to negative
* The button marked "%" will divide the displayed number by 100 and show the result

even when it is unnecessary
